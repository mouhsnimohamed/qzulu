title: Our Businesses | Deployment Ready
heading: >-
There is a wide range of commercial opportunities that we are addressing
across many industries through our Joint Venture, and these commercial
opportunities are the means by which we are incorporating and deploying our
dynamic Quantum technologies in the province of KwaZulu Natal.

Although our primary focus involves the communities inhabited by the millions
of residents of KwaZulu Natal, the economic and commercial impacts of our
business activities are felt across South Africa with even broader positive
implications for the African continent and even internationally.This is
because our businesses are focused on producing new goods and services, and
improving the existing goods and services already produced in these
communities.

By expanding and improving these local economies through our value-added
technologies, we empower these communities to develop stronger commercial ties
across South Africa, broaden trading relationships across the sub-Saharan
region, positively contribute to the ongoing transformation of the economies
of the African continent, and deepen the international trade ties that reward
the export sector.

Some of our companies’ deployment-ready solutions and their business
activities include the following:
