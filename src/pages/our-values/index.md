      The introduction of advanced quantum technologies that do no currently
      exist in the Ingonyama region of South Africa provide us with the
      opportunity to dynamically contribute to the economic landscape in the
      province of KwaZulu Natal.   New industries will evolve from these
      technologies, and existing technologies will be rendered more modern and
      adaptable.

      As a contributor to the economic vitality of the region, it is incumbent
      upon our Joint Venture to follow best international practices related to
      sustainability and social accountability.  This relates to the communities
      we serve, our employees, other stakeholders, commercial counterparties,
      the Kingdom of Zululand, and the local, provincial, and national
      government.

      More than twelve million people reside in the region that has historically
      and traditionally been associated with the Kingdom of Zululand.  The
      creation of additional jobs in existing industries and companies is of
      great importance, as is the stimulation of employment opportunities in
      emerging industries and companies related to our dynamism.

      The negative impact that many industries across the global has had on the
      environment leaves much to be desired due to the degradation of land,
      pollution in the atmosphere, and the spoiling of waterways.  It is our
      ethical, social, and moral responsibility to always be positive economic
      stewards of the environment, and to contribute to the sustainability of
      the lands and communities we positively impact.

### Shade-grown coffee

Coffee is a small tree or shrub that grows in the forest understory in its wild form, and traditionally was grown commercially under other trees that provided shade. The forest-like structure of shade coffee farms provides habitat for a great number of migratory and resident species.

### Sustainable farming

Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.
