Our Quantum Kingdom of Zululand initiative is a strategic partnership that was established to transform the Ingonyama region of South Africa into a regional and continental hallmark of economic success.

With approximately twelve million residents in the area that has historically and traditionally been known as the Kingdom of Zululand, the opportunity to dynamically and positively impact the lives of those in the region is our primary focus.

Our approach has been modeled after the Singaporean brand by implementing next-generation Quantum technologies and solutions, a strategy that has successfully transformed Singapore into a shining, global example of advanced economic success.  This approach exemplifies the positive economic impact and transformation that catalyze greater employment, higher incomes, economic expansion, diversified industries, and an increasing level of worker productivity.

Quantum Kingdom of Zululand is a Joint Venture between Quantum Age Corporation and Ingonyama Holdings.  Quantum Age Corporation is a private company registered in Singapore that develops and implements advanced technology solutions, and is empowered to facilitate and manage the technology solutions with other information technology and communications partners.

Ingonyama Holdings has a mandate to maximize the material welfare and social well-being of the members and constituents of the Zulu Nation, as well as the other communities inhabiting the 2.883 million hectares that it administers in the province of KwaZulu Natal, South Africa.  The goal of Ingonyama Holdings is to ensure the sustainable development of the Ingonyama region.
